## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[ELOQUENT JAVASCRIPT,https://www.w3schools.com/]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[A challenge faced during the creation of this app is when it came to javascript I was bit confused a first when we started creating so many functions . A way I overcame this challenge was basically reading very carefully to understand what these functions are doing and how functions work as a whole.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Whats the key differences bewtwen web deveopment and software development? What are the biggest differences between mobile and desktop development? What is the difference between undefined value and null value?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project I wouldâ€™ve added additional features to see the outcome of the app and also refactored functions to see the end result. I had such a fun time creating this app it really opened my eyes to what I can build in the future. I had a blast using javascript. ]
